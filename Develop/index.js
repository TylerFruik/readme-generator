## Finished Product

### [ðŸ”—Project Link](https://tylerfruik.github.io/Frontend-Quiz/)
This project involved the same use of HTML, CSS, and JS that we have experienced in previous weeks with the addition of WebAPI calls and advanced functions.

This page is responsive to resizing and the code is well annotated.

This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JS files as well as all necessary images in the /assets/ folder.

All code written manually by Tyler Fruik

### The following is an image of the final webpage:
